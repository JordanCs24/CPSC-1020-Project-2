Description: A program that allows a player to answer quiz questions. The game allows
adding questions and answers to a database in a simple text file. The program
asks the questions in the database in random order. The player types an answer
and hits enter. If the answer is correct, the player is told so and the player earns
1 point. If the answer is incorrect, the player is told so and the players loses 1
point. Once all questions have been asked, the program displays how many
questions have been asked, the number of correct answers, the number of wrong
answers, and the playerâ€™s final score.
